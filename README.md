## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need rust and cargo installed on your machine. You can install both
very quickly using rustup. See the Rust installation instructions for more
info: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

### Running

Clone the git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umcconnell/rust_fibonacci.git
cd rust_fibonacci/
```

Then, run the benchmarks and compare the different methods:

```bash
cargo bench
```

Happy coding!
